<p class="drop-cap">“M<span class="smcap first-word">y</span> name is Molly. This is the name
my mistress gave me, and now every
one calls me by it.</p>

<p>“Four years ago I was a little calf. At
first I was as helpless as a babe, and had to
be fed with my mother’s milk.</p>

<p>“At that time I was of no use to my master;
but the children were very fond of me,
and they often came into the field to play
with me.</p>

<p>“Sometimes they tied ribbons round my
neck, and called me pet names, and we all
had a good romp together in the meadow.</p>

<p>“Now I am a grown-up cow, and I give
milk to all the little children who live at the
farm.</p>

<p>“I do not play with them now as I did
when I was a calf; but when they offer me a
bunch of nice clover, I am always glad to eat
it.</p>

<p>“There comes Nancy, the milk-maid, with
the milk-pail. She is coming to milk me,
and I am glad I have plenty to give her.</p>

<p>“My master is very kind to me. In winter,
when the cold weather comes, I have a
nice home to live
in, with plenty of
clean straw to lie
on.</p>

</div>

<p>“In summer I
am out in the
green fields all
the day long. I
have plenty to eat, and nothing to do.</p>

<p>“I do not work like the horse. So the
least I can do is to supply my master with
plenty of milk; indeed it is for my milk that
he keeps me. Perhaps you do not know how
useful milk is. Cream, butter, and cheese are
all made from it.</p>

<p>“And now little boys and girls, after this
long talk I must go down to the river side
and cool myself.”</p>

<p>The good cow marched away down to the
river. She was soon standing in the water,
and using her long tail to whisk away the
flies that were buzzing about her.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap first-word">here</span> was a calf in the lot, and Al took
the tin pail in his hand and went out
to feed it.</p>

<p>Al thought it would be quite as glad to get
its breakfast as the pigs were to get theirs.</p>

<p>But the calf did nothing of the kind. It
had no horns as yet, but there were two knobs
on its head which would soon grow up into
sharp horns, and when Al came out with the
tin pail, the calf bent her head and gave the
pail a butt with these hard bits of horns.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Al, “I can not force you to
eat if you do not want to.”</p>

<p>So he went back to the house and set the
pail down in the yard, and said to Em, “I
tried to feed the calf, but she would not eat,
and now it is time for me to go off to my
work.”</p>

<p>“Would not eat?” said Em. “I will see
about that.” So she took up the tin pail and
went out to the lot where the calf was tied.</p>

<p>Em came up to where the calf was, gave
her one or two pats on the head, and three
strokes down the side, and called her all the
pet names she could think of.</p>

<div class="figright illowp50" id="illus007" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus007.png"  alt="Em feeding the calf from a pail" width="600" height="500" />
</div>

<p>“Now, my pet Snow-drop,” she said,
“here is a nice
breakfast I have
brought you, and I
want you to eat it
all, so that you can
grow fat and strong.
You will, won’t
you? She was my
own dear little pet calf so she was; and no one
shall be cross to her or hurt her. Here is
milk, and bread, and all sorts of nice things;
now come and eat.”</p>

<p>And what did that calf do but put her head
in the pail and eat as if she would never get
her fill. She licked, and licked, and licked
the pail, while Em stood by and laughed, and
said to herself, “Well, a calf is just like a
child. When it will not eat, you must just
coax it, and pet it, and not scold or use cross
words or looks. It is strange that <ins class="corr" id="tn1" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;The original text 'e-ven' has been left unchanged">e-ven the
dumb beast</ins> feels the force of a kind word.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap" id="single-letter">I <span class="smcap first-word">am</span> sure that all of you know me, and
think that I am a useful sort of creature.
I suppose most of you have had a ride in a
wagon or carriage
drawn by
me or some
other horse.</p>

</div>

<p>When I was
a boy-horse I was
called a colt. I
lived then on a
farm, and did no
work, but played most of the time in the fields.
You may see by the picture on this page that
I was made quite a pet of by the young folks
on the farm. Pleasant times, indeed, those
were with me!</p>

<p>But when I was about four years old, I was
“broken in.” You may not know just what
that means, so I will tell you. It means to
teach a horse to work. He must get used to
having a bit in his mouth, and learn to wear a
bridle, a collar, a saddle, and a crupper.</p>

<p>He must submit to being harnessed, and
hitched to a wagon or carriage. He must
stand still when he is told to, and walk or trot,
fast or slow, just as his driver wishes.</p>

<p>He must not start nor jump at anything he
sees, nor bite, nor kick, nor have any will of
his own, but always do his master’s bidding.
A horse when he feels good is inclined to show
his joy by prancing about, and when tired he
likes to lie down; but he must learn not to
follow these inclinations when he is in harness
or under the saddle.</p>

<p>Just think what a disagreeable thing it would
be to have a bit in your mouth! A piece of
hard, cold metal pressing on your tongue, and
held on by straps about your head so that you
cannot get rid of it. I thought it was dreadful
at first, but after a while grew so used to it
that I did not mind it.</p>

<p>It was so with all the other things. It took
time to make me reconciled to submit to them,
but by degrees they seemed easier and easier,
and now, as I have a kind master, I am
glad that I am able to be useful to him.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
